/**
 Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number.
 You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.

 Note:
 The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.

 Example:

 int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
 Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

 // pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
 solution.pick(3);

 // pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
 solution.pick(1);

     Reservoir Sampling
     Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing k samples from a list of n items,
     where n is either a very large or unknown number.

     Typically n is large enough that the list doesnâ€™t fit into main memory.
     For example, a list of search queries in Google and Facebook.
